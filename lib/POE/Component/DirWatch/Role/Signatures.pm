=head1 NAME

POE::Component::DirWatch::Role::Signatures

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Component::DirWatch::Role::Signatures is a role which provides
L<File::Signature> functionality to DirWatch-based classes. It will keep a
hashref of signatures of the files processing to allow you to determine if
a file has changed.

Read-write. Will return a hashref in which keys will be the full path of the
files seen and the value will be a File::Signature object

=head1 METHODS

C<after '_file_callback'> Add the file's signature to C<signatures> if it
doesnt yet exist.
